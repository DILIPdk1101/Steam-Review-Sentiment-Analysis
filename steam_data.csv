The guns are wrong for recoil and most servers are set to run 3ft and your huffing and puffing ..  but the game can be very fun, all depends i guess, and like every game people hack and they never get kicked unless there killing 50 people per second.so it should be called day of the cheat. But over all its a good game and worth the money if you can find good servers. the more i play this game the more i hate it. you can get some really fun games, but the game was made in 2005, but plays like a game from 1995, no ballistics at all. the guns are about a joke and model nothing of an actual firearm. Counter strike source has so much more to realism than this game, though its on the same engine. I honestly wish this game would get a deserved update and bring it back to the main stream. Would be nice to get two game modes, Classic and updated or something of that sort, so die hard players wont lose out on there no phyics game.but people that play newer games might also get into this.

I recommend using the default aspect ratio, it doesn't play well with modern widescreen resolutions. But if that doesn't sound daunting, this is a neat little bite sized bit of Half Life lore and exploration. I sincerely doubt it will take anyone more than 5 hours to finish, which is good because Gearbox definitely doesn't have Valve's same flair for level design or atmosphere. The pieces are all there but they're not as neatly fitted together. And it's hard to say it's not worth it at 5 bucks full price, but it goes on sale every major steam event so maybe wait for the discount.",76561198059308873,Positive

Its full of bots, other than the well-known sniper bots that plague casual, working together to kick any actual player that tries to play. There are idle bots, farming the random item drops. Trade bots, that trade with either other bots or players trying to get rid of some items. And of course, the previously mentioned sniper bots, accompanied by heavy bots with perfect tracking, and even scout bots, that run around hitting each other with a fish. 
The devs implemented a fee to talk in chat, as if that would help at all. That has to be the only thing they have done. They have otherwise made sure they added a new crate for each season, just to make sure you're still spending money on the game. The game is neglected, and at this point, its better off finally, truly dying.

original review:
Counter-Strike: Source.
Buy it.
The game itself is fun. Even if your internet is down, you can still
play with (opinionally difficult) AI, on any map you've downloaded.
But the mods for the game are what really give it replay value.
There are MANY types: deathrun, mini-game, gun-game, jail break, et cetera.
There are always thousands of people on this game at all times,
even in the mornings (I have stood up late playing this).
Also, if you get bored with the gun/player/prop appearances,
you can get skins for anything (the skinning base is large).
Overall, a great game. Get it, you will enjoy hundreds (atleast) of hours out of it.",76561197995498901,Negative

A classic game, it can be easily mistaken as one of those games that fill your library but goes untouched, which is a big mistake. This game was mostly overlooked during the time of its release and neglected as nobody was ready for a Counter-Strike ""story mode"" game. And who can blame the playerbase, at a time when a multiplayer Counter-Strike was at the height of its popularity with the rise of ESports and thousands of dollars in tournaments. But, like many movies that flop and turn into cult classic later in their time, Condition Zero deleted scenes by Ritual Entertainment is an amazing change, it's like playing Half-life but with Counter-Strike flowing through it, like some strange lovechild of the two franchises. I would argue this game is the original Call of Duty, offering the same thing from an equally huge blockbuster title.

130335472,240,"Counter-Strike: Source is a classic first-person shooter game that was released in 2004 by Valve Corporation. It is a pretty good shooter choice among competitive players and those who want to have fun. The fact that Counter-Strike: Source has a large number of maps and game modes to choose from, it keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting. 

CSS is a shooter that has stood the test of time, thanks to its well-balanced gameplay, strong team-based dynamics, and intense firefights. The game features a wide variety of weapons, maps, and game modes, making it suitable for players of all skill levels.

One reason that Counter-Strike: Source is still a good game is because it has a high level of skill ceiling. The game is very competitive and requires a lot of practice and skill to master. This makes it a good game for those who enjoy challenging themselves and improving their abilities.

Another reason that the game aged well is because it has a strong focus on teamwork and strategy. The game requires players to work together and communicate effectively in order to succeed. This makes it a great game for those who enjoy teamwork and strategic thinking, especially on game modes like zombie escape, zombie hunting and many others.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Source is a well-designed and highly competitive first-person shooter game that is suitable for players of all skill levels. If you enjoy teamwork, strategy, and first-person shooter games, then you should definitely give Counter-Strike: Source a try.",76561198213343780,Positive

It is not EA-Kernel-Level Rootkit bad, but still absurd. You have to 'register' mandatory 10+ lines of 'personal information' and then enter the Serial Key, to get an 'Activation Key' of some sorts.

BEWARE IF YOU WANT TO USE dgVoodoo2 or other DLLs!

It will trigger another Registration/Activation process, each time, you drop in a DLL or change the Windows Compatibility Setting of the EXE. You have to remember the bogus entries you entered the first time, or the re-activation will fail, telling you 'cannot connect to server ... something something'.

Why would you want to add dgVoodoo2 DLLs? Because the 'default' game looks like pixelated garbage, unless you use some kind of DX wrapper or compatibility mode that actually renders the game in accelerated 3D and you can finally read the fonts.

Cannot recommend this thing to no one.

The Spy deftly dodges and parries Sniper’s flailing attacks and counters with fatal strikes; the Sniper is cut across his left cheek (1:55), gutted under the right rib cage (1:57), cut across the back of his skull (1:58), and is ultimately backstabbed (1:59).]

""My beloved Counter-Strike: A Poetic Tribute"" by .jen

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Welcome to 1.6 - the only game that still holds true.
CTs are good, Ts are bad,
One wrong move, you'll surely be mad.

From Dust2's sands to Inferno's core,
From Train's whistle to Nuke's squeeky door.
CTs brace, while Ts endure,
AKs and M4s, their battles pure.

Spray and pray, the noobs may say,
But pros have skill, in every way.
Pugs and pubs, where players meet,
Only the best are called 31337.

Owned with a headshot, outplayed with finesse,
FBs and HEs, causing distress.
SGs obscure, USPs gleam,
Deagle 1 deags, a player's dream.

Glocks and Dualies, pistols in hand,
In 5v5 clashes, where victory stands.
Aces and clutches, moments of fate,
""I am the one and only,"" the last to elate.

Sharp knives slice, ""Humiliation"" with sting,
Bhopping and boosting, where skill takes wing.
Hold W and rush B, the call resounds,
C4s ticking, victory surrounds.

Wallbangs echo, through the halls,
As pros execute, their flawless calls.
Laughs and cries, fill the air,
""Fire in the hole"", players beware.

Flick shots and aims, dominating foes,
In 1.6, where legends arose.
So pick up your might, and join the fray,
In 1.6, where heroes play.

FIN

My version was somehow really broken and i couldn't find any info on how to resolve it.

The combat is janky. Voice acting is on par with Tommy Wiseau's The Room. Hit registration only worked 50% of the time. The character animations were locked to 10 fps. The terrain switched colours from red to green to blue in mere seconds making the game look like a cheap discothèque from the 80's. I somehow could talk to a chicken and was locked out of the option to escape the dialogue with the game saving over and ruining my savestate.

The game was based on the old flash game alien shooter where you control a marine on a third-person view above the head.  It is a welcome break if your eyes is tired from playing too much FPS which is what most Source SDK are made of.  The leveling system is not very hard too, no more thinking of where to spend points as this one only unlocks new equipment instead of earning stat or skill points.  All in all, its just dive in and have fun! 

The game makes heavy use of team play and class requirements based on mission objective, so your team can't just be picking their favorite marine and just shoot shoot shoot, it needs team work.  Some mission requires heavy use of medic, most requires heavy use of tech.

One down side I guess is the lack of single player mode/mission/map to get you acquainted with the game, but that's probably not all bad since there are a lot of players who are nice enough to carry you.  Give it a try!",76561198090617400,Positive

In the trenches deep and narrow, where the mud clung to our boots,
Stood the soldiers of the Fatherland, resolute in their pursuits.
With a rifle by their side, they faced the battles fierce and grim,
Their courage never faltering, through the horrors of the din.
Oh, the German rifle of World War One,
A weapon forged in fire, under the blazing sun.
With precision and power, it served its nation well,
In the hands of brave soldiers, in the stories they would tell.
With its bolt action mechanism, and its sturdy wooden stock,
It became a symbol of strength, in the chaos and the shock.
From the fields of Flanders to the forests dark and deep,
The German rifle echoed, as the weary soldiers sleep.
Oh, the German rifle of World War One,
A guardian of the homeland, under the setting sun.
Through the battles and the bloodshed, it held its steadfast line,
A testament to valor, in the annals of time.
Though the war may be over, and the soldiers long gone,
The memory of their rifle, forever will live on.
For in the hearts of a nation, and the stories that we share,
The German rifle of World War One, will always be there.
So here's to the brave soldiers, who marched into the fray,
With the German rifle in hand, they fought for freedom's day.
Their sacrifice remembered, in the songs that we now sing,
For the German rifle of World War One, forever shall it ring.
As the years rolled on and conflict once more loomed,
The German rifle returned, in the darkest of gloom.
From the fields of Normandy to the Russian front so vast,
It stood as a guardian, in a world torn apart and vast.
Oh, the German rifle of World War Two,
A testament to resilience, tried and true.
Through the battles and the bombings, it held its steadfast might,
Guiding soldiers through the darkness, in the never-ending fight.
With its familiar bolt action, and its deadly aim,
It became a symbol of hope, amidst the fear and the pain.
Through the ruins of Berlin, and the streets of Stalingrad,
The German rifle soldiered on, through the good and the bad.
Oh, the German rifle of World War Two,
A beacon in the chaos, shining bright and true.
In the hands of brave soldiers, it wrote history's tale,
In the face of overwhelming odds, it would never fail.
Though the battles may have ended, and the scars may still remain,
The legacy of the German rifle, forever will sustain.
For in the annals of warfare, and the stories that we tell,
The German rifle of World War Two, will always cast its spell.
So here's to the brave soldiers, who fought with all their might,
With the German rifle in hand, they marched into the fight.
Their courage and their sacrifice, in our memories will endure,
For the German rifle of World War Two, forever shall be pure.",76561198072310730,Positive

Gunplay is a little primitive, but there's nothing as satisfying as figuring out a strategy to get through an area with the minimal risk to your safety. 

The weapons each serve a different purpose, and you should find yourself using all of them throughout the game to fight your enemies. 

The enemy range is broad, and you'll always have to adapt your game strategy to defeat them effectively. 

This is not a run and gun shooter, but the satisfaction from killing enemies is always rewarding.

83487625,70,"I’m not really sure why this game is so highly rated, there is a lot wrong with it.

Personally, I really am not liking it. It could have been incredibly back in the day, but it isn’t so good now. There just isn’t much good about the game. I had my hopes up for the story, but it has been rather simple and not really good, though I haven’t been through too much to have a strong opinion. Gameplay is mediocre at best. A lot of the enemies don’t feel like they are taking damage, so it’s difficult to judge if you have hit your shots or not. Sometimes, the shots just simply don’t hit, maybe some small box got in the way but even when shooting point blank with a shotgun some enemies will still survive because it somehow “missed”. The mobs aren’t that fun to fight. They have small hit boxes, jump at you before you can react. Another one has hitscan weapons so it’s hard to fight them if you don’t have natural regeneration. The “puzzles” aren’t fun, but more frustrating. I often got stuck because I didn’t know what to do. I felt like I got softlocked multiple times. I even had to look up how to pass a certain level, which involved hitting a power switch which looked like some simple decoration and not the key to progress. The graphics are shit, I mean it’s 20 years old I knew what to expect, and the sound effects are also shit, yes I know it’s old but it still doesn’t help. The game also doesn’t seem to have a proper soundtrack, which is something I really dislike. It doesn’t have to be incredible or always present, but at least doing something like portal would have been nice. All in all, the clunky combat, bad parkour, no natural regeneration, confusing puzzles don’t mix well with the fact that the game is 20 years old. It might appeal to other people, after all I’m not a FPS guy, but I don’t really understand the hype of the game. Maybe half life 2 is better, I’ll give it a shot, but I think I will abandon or refund this game because I really was expected something good, I really only want to play a 20 year old game if it is an absolute gem, but unfortunately this game isn’t it.

10 hours later, still don't like it. I found out that I was getting motion sick from the game so i messed around and changed some settings to make it less sickening. I always feel lost when playing, the game doesn't guide you to important areas like newer games such as hollow knight, lacking that great game design. I missed several important weapons that could have made it so much easier to continue. I had to watch a walkthrough to find directions and learn how to work through the stupidly confusing world. I always felt like I had to quick save every minute because of the terrible health design where you can lose half your health from a stray grenade that you cannot naturally regenerate. I haven't been enjoying it, maybe a remaster might be better, but I might be abandoning this game soon.",76561199110492434,Negative

63159424,50,"Opposing Force is the better, longer expansion of Half-Life, but also the more tedious to play. Everything was a joy ride till the c*nts in black suit. They are ridiculously fast, extremely bullet-sponge because headshot means nothing, and they aim-bot you, some can even become invisible; meanwhile, you stuck with large meh collection of guns, that keep you questioning ""Did I even hit anything?"", and quite annoying to change in between by default binds. In addition, later levels design are all about tight and dark places, they keep spamming you tons of enemies, then you have to deal with the sh*tty nightvision that not only makes it harder to see the crosshair but also causes frame drops. It's not a decent challenge anymore but trial-and-error with F6/F7. The company AI is hilariously bad. The pathway could be confusing. The physics is detrimental with slippery movement and random stuck/damaging. It's just not fun toward the end.

In overall, the game can be enjoyable with normal, I believe it's around 6-7, but on Hard mode, cheap score for such cheap design 3-4. Thus came to the conclusion of 5 -average. And since Valve let me play it for free, that I don't have to buy it (and I won't) then I probably leave it recommended.

Valve needs to put a REAL effort into fixing this game. TF2 is basically Steam's mascot game at this point, it's heartbreaking to see it in its current state.

My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

In 2022 I tried VALORANT and quit after a few matches with a bad taste in my mouth going back to CS, a game I've been playing for a long time before. I practically swore I wouldn't try VALORANT once again, but with CS2's release and the state Valve left this game in... It actually made me move to VALORANT.

It's been a year since then and the game hasn't changed a bit. I had a huge expectations for CS2 after the beta launched since it was a great chance to create a better game than VALORANT and make even more money, but month after month, nothing's changed and it goes on the same, horrible way. We got a bare bones game that feels delayed for a few milliseconds, still does to this very day.

If CS:GO and VALORANT in 2023 felt like a healthy competitors and it was up to players preference which game to play, now it makes CS2 look like a paralyzed man in a wheelchair who has to ring a bell to communicate vs. VALORANT who visits this man and mocks him over how helpless he is.

Although VALORANT is already facing a fate of every hero shooter with new heroes being released every now and then, I still would've chosen to play it instead of a sludge we got as ""new cs game"".

138417746,1510,"Based on playing Uplink alone, I'd get the impression that the developer of this game is kind of person who, if they were creating any other type of software, would respond to user complaints with, ""But it works for me. The issue must be on your end."" Many of the mechanics, interface, and events are clunky and unintuitive, as if the developer knew the game inside and out and simply expected others to play it the way he did based on the knowledge within his head without being informed how. Uplink is a major pain to play if you try to play blind as I did most of the time, and it's still very annoying if you consult a guide throughout your playthrough.

I was irritated for the first few hours by server nodes randomly seeming to disappear on the connection map and become unselectable. It turned out there was an option to toggle visibility for each one in another server selection menu and that that setting was merely being overridden when the nodes became mission locations or when selected as part of a saved connection chain. This wouldn't be a problem in itself and is actually a helpful feature to reduce map clutter, but the game did not explicitly communicate this, including in the Help menu and tutorial where you are told about many of the other mechanics and interface elements in the game.

Also, every version of the Log Deleter program from v1.0-v3.0 becomes useless later on, and if you don't take v4.0 after a certain point, you will eventually become a dead man walking and 100% get a delayed Game Over with virtually no sign that this is why you failed, even if you otherwise did everything else right, and this will delete over an hour of saved progress each time due to permadeath being added as a mechanic despite a lot more emphasis being placed on long-term progress and trial-and-error gameplay than in other rogue-lites. I quickly learned to manually back up my save files regularly.

However, the ending portion is the worst of all due to how easy it is to make the game effectively or completely unwinnable.

[spoiler]In the late-game storyline, the ARC organization is trying to take down the Internet by developing a computer worm called Revelation, while Arunmor is trying to stop them with an anti-malware program called Faith. In the ARC route, Revelation can go up to v3.0, and you basically need to develop it all the way there, not just v2.0, in order to avoid the bad ending even if you take down Faith all the way down to v0.2, as Revelation won't spread quickly enough otherwise before the flames are stamped out unless possibly if you install the malware on each computer with TAS-level menu navigation speed. If you have in-game animations turned on, you will have even less of a chance due to your keyboard inputs within server consoles being delayed at some points and inputs skipped if you try to enter characters during those delays. This, again, wouldn't be a problem in itself. However, completing all of the missions ARC sends you isn't actually enough to guarantee you reach v3.0, only v2.0. The game does not communicate this in any way, nor does it spell out how you can get v3.0 or that a v3.0 is even possible.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]In addition, if you don't reply to ARC's proposal to join them within a week, neither they nor Arunmor will respond to any e-mails you send them afterwards, cutting you off from taking either's route in the standard way. The game does not communicate that this will happen. However, this is presumably to simulate a living world where others will do their thing without you if you let time pass by, and this, yet again, isn't a problem in itself. You can instead take Arunmor's missions as they're posted publicly on the jobs board over time. However, if you do this, Arunmor will never post the last mission to stop ARC once and for all, even after you perform a dozen-plus non-storyline missions and speed up time for months until next year. If you don't reply to ARC's email, the game will become unwinnable, and there will be no indication of this until in-game months and easily over a real-life hour later.[/spoiler]",76561197961104343,Negative

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",76561197966473494,Positive

34639164,130,"Pretty underwhelming expansion, nowhere near as good as Opposing Force. Supposedly Gearbox trying to emulate the original Half-Life rather than doing something new like Opposing Force. I guess, but it's Half-Life with drab, boring environments and very few memorable setpieces. It's also really short, which is arguably a good thing given the complete lack of imagination on display. 

I can't say it's bad but unless you're a big Half-Life fan there are better things to spend four hours on.",76561197981069264,Negative

If you're going to play with friends this is the best one you could pick, but if you're looking to play seriously or competitively it's honestly pretty awful at that.

The community around it is also a lot more laid back and casual.

I wouldn't ever go as far as to outright say CSS is bad, it's not. But there's a reason fans weren't that keen on it as a (supposed) remake of 1.6.

They are more than capable of doing the bare minimum in updates to keep the game playable, and given it's economy, it would only be a net benefit for valve to do so, amd despite this, they chose absolute neglegence, and leave it's servers with more bot traffic than human traffic. Bots that not only make the game unplayable, but extort real human players with their personal info, in some cases just by exploiting how the servers work.

This game has become a hazard to public health and safety.

Just a few months ago reviews where overwelmingly negative. I'm not sure if everyone's forgotten, or if valve has launched a purge of the reviews, but the instant you stop bullying them because they breifly act like they acknowledge you.

107692262,30,"Day of Rout is genuinely a failed to remember pearl, past the time to get prominence in the cutting edge age yet mature enough that it actually gathered a truly slick player base. Try not to misunderstand me however, it's essentially Counter-Strike yet set in The Second Great War time, with each group getting their separate weapons to battle with. With the vast majority of my time I've figured out how to find 2 seperate networks, basically PvE (players against bots in the contrary group) and I've stayed with that. However I'm certain the interactivity is static among that and the conventional PvP battles that you would expect out of Counter-Strike.

THE Upside:

The Interactivity:

As conventional as it sounds, the by and large ongoing interaction circle is still similarly as reviving as could be expected. Indeed, even almost 20 years after the fact the game can feel similarly as amusing to play as it did when it came out. However while you are restricted to an unmistakable measure of firearms (as I'll indicate beneath) it doesn't degrade as much from the overall feel of the game.

The custom substance:

With the age of any game comes the expectation that capable fans will go along and give additional player-made substance to a game, and with Day of Rout this is particularly so. There are Huge loads of extra guides that you can insight. It's totally an or more that the game exists in the Goldsrc motor as there's an abundant measure of individuals that are anxious to give new substance that everybody can appreciate.

The Tasteful:

This is more for individuals who long for a more established day. While indeed, my recess with this game is undeniably later than a heap of others that actually play this game today (I've placed in just ~6 hours as of this audit) this game actually gives a somewhat quieting and nostalgic stylish on account of its age and its general feel, something I would like over its more present day (and more famous) partner, Counter-Strike.

The People group:

While this offers a great deal with the abovementioned, it's likewise truly ideal to experience truly cordial and inviting individuals to have the option to partake in the game with. Huge and sweeping, it's great to observe that a many individuals that play Day of Rout will more often than not be on the more pleasant side, making my time in Day of Rout significantly more agreeable. Each time I bounce on, I anticipate playing with individuals I've become acquainted with!

THE Terrible:

The Weapon Choice:

In Day of Rout you're compelled to pick one out of a few classes, which is genuinely commonplace, however rather than getting a decision of loadout you're left with preset weapons on one or the other side. A shooter is ordinarily stayed with his separate quick firing rifle, an Expert Sergeant is left with his individual SMG, etc. While it's fine having the option to pick between classes, it's not difficult to see that the decision between weapons overall is somewhat poor.

The Age:

The most concerning issue that this game countenances is that, clearly, it's very nearly twenty years old. On par with what it is, you'll need to become acclimated to the substance with no guarantees, in light of the fact that there's positively zero chance of Valve returning to add more substance. While you'll in any case have the option to get a very sizable amount of player-made substance, it's conceivable you'll never see a legitimate game update for Day of Rout again.

THE End:

While it's exceptionally obvious that this game is matured and it slipped close's mind, the networks that actually exist in the game keep it particularly alive. While it isn't quite so flourishing as most games in this age, at the cost it will be it's unquestionably worth the outing back on schedule to partake in some exemplary 2000s trickeries.",76561198964096102,Positive

Classes in TFC have different abilities, and their own class-specific grenades which can be used in a variety of situations, creating a rock-paper-scissors form of gameplay.

Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now

Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the Cee-Lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45's and gauges, MACs in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TECs
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20s of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

157212251,10,"""Counter-Strike 1.6"" є класичною грою, яка визначила жанр стрільби від першої особи (FPS) і вплинула на покоління геймерів. Зараз, незважаючи на своє вікно, гра залишається вельми популярною та виглядає як символ в історії відеоігор.

Однією з основних переваг ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" є його геймплей, який поєднує в собі простоту та стратегічну глибину. Збалансована система зброї, реалістична фізика та картинка гри дозволяють гравцям відчувати глибокий іммерсивний досвід. Величезна кількість карт та режимів гри забезпечує різноманітність, завдяки чому кожен поєдинок виглядає як унікальне пригода.

Мультіплеєр - справжня сила гри, адже ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" створений для командної гри. Співпраця та координація важливі для досягнення успіху, що робить гру особливо захоплюючою для тих, хто цінує стратегічний підхід.

Гра також вражає своєю витриманістю та стійкістю. Навіть після багатьох років, вона зберігає свою активність в онлайн-спільноті, завдяки чому новачки можуть насолоджуватися грою разом із ветеранами.

Однак, з часом, гра втратила у своїй графіці в порівнянні з більш сучасними FPS. На сьогоднішній день деякі аспекти гри можуть здатися застарілими, але вони все ще мають свою чарівність і можуть привертати гравців з усього світу.

У підсумку, ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" - це не просто гра, а легенда, яка залишається невід'ємною частиною історії відеоігор. Для тих, хто цінує класику та глибокий геймплей, вона залишається важливим етапом в світі відомих ігор.",76561198816179244,Positive

Some of the maps are really cozy and people aren't even really fighting, Guessing they're just taking a trip down memory lane.
I was hoping to make a normal review about this game, but in the state it is now that's pretty much impossible.
If this game for whatever weird reason takes off at some point of time, I might update this review then.
The gameplay feels like HL1, nothing odd about that. When you actually find a server with people playing in it, it's actually not hard to keep up if you're used to FPS games.

Note: This is a review of the Deleted Scenes campaign only. The content/replayability score does take in other modes however.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++N/A

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Sound design's actually somewhat decent with some really punchy weapon effects and half-decent environmental effects
+There's something oddly enjoyable about Gold Source's engine despite its annoying quirks. I honestly can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure plenty of people can relate.
+There's some bonus levels outside of the campaign
+The combat isn't totally without its' merits

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]
+-The devs actually managed to do some impressive things with the engine. Animating dead bodies to look like true ragdoll as in other games for one, and animating crumpling paper and crushing boxes for some more. I don't know how they managed to do some of it on the engine, but it actually does a good job of mimicking
real physics. It absolutely doesn't save this game's presentation, though.
-+The voice acting isn't the worst thing in the world but it's certainly not good, and the phony accents don't help

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-If you're below 25 health, all you can really do is pray to the RNG gods that both the enemy will decide to miss you and that your weapons will be accurate, which aren't often the case. So sometimes you'll go around a corner and die over and over until you get lucky and the enemies decide to miss and your bullets
decide to hit where you're aiming.
-Hit detection is awful, and I know I'm not mistaking it for inaccurate weaponry
-Reload animations are annoyingly long
-Movement is as slippery as Half-Life's, but much slower. Given how many thin ledges and platforming is required from you, I have to wonder who thought giving the character roller-skates was a good idea.
-The campaign is very short. Under 4 hours even on Hard. There are some bonus maps, however.
-Enemy placement is BS sometimes, but especially on the last level
-There is no story. There are settings and objectives for each level, but they're totally self-contained.
-It's barely a challenge for at least half the game, but then the enemy placements get more annoying and it starts kicking your butt some more
-Music's forgettable
-The stealth sections work about as well as you'd expect on this engine. Thankfully, they're rare and cheese-able.
-There's a really annoying glitch where loading a save makes you fire automatically until you press the fire button yourself. It got me killed many times.
-The FOV is too small and can't be changed

[b]The Horrible:[/b]
--This game came out in 2004... two thousand and fucking four. Yet, it barely looks better than the original Half-Life, which ALREADY looked out of date 6 years ago! To compare this game visually to Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Thief Deadly Shadows, or, you know, ANY game released in 2004, is like comparing the U.S. healthcare
to any other first-world country -- it's nothing but a laughing stock.
--Counter-Strike's trademark nonsensical, ridiculous recoil system made playing this more and more annoying. It's often up to RNG as to whether you'll actually hit anything thanks to random weapon spread mixed with strong recoil. Sometimes you can get two easy headshots without a problem, and sometimes you'll miss
even with your crosshair clearly right on their head and even shots point blank at their body. It's just absurd.
--Incredibly repetitive. Shoot similar types of braindead enemies over and over while planting a bomb or pulling out a gadget every now and then.

Sound: 5.5/10
Graphics: 2/10
Gameplay: 4/10
Content/Replayability: 8/10
Overall: 4.5/10

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Not a dreadful experience, but I can't recommend it. Good for a nostalgia trip if you played this at the time, or just to kill a few hours, but that's about it.

98857082,280,"[INTRODUCTION]

What of the most remaster game that never gets update and lies is half-life source, making it one of the most hate game ever. before SDK 2013 the game didnt have bug but still look like half-life 1 but with some half-life 2 movement and source engine of features. after SDK 2013 released they got bug, the devs got tired to fix all of them so they fixed bit, and left it. the lastst update is nov 25 2013. there is a fix mod but hey whos going play it. what you can do is that you can just play it on GMOD and dont have any issues with it but there some small, lucky there is a mod that changes hls maps into the larger map. anyways here is some good features and bad features


[GOOD  & BAD FEATURE]

these are good and bad features, not sure if i missed some


LIVE BACKGROUND - remember about half-life 2 when you launch the game you have live of background, well it also has a feature in half-life source, however there is a live background which when the guard enters in and shoots tentacle, when tentacle wokes up he tries to kill the guard who shot him but doesnt kill the guard and no he doesnt run away before getting kill, he just stands there and keeps shooting at tentacle
WATER - water has some spalsh when you shoot or do something but the water quality looks very low compression to the other game
RAGDOLL - they have feature of ragdoll phsyics which is good feature, unlike goldsrc which  dont have ragdoll you have to setup a code for it, if you want to add ragdoll phsyics to the original half-life then good luck trying to follow the steps
LIGHT & SHADOW - Lights are bit better, but sometime they cause glitchly and some weird things, lucky they fixed flashlight, sometime there is brightness room that they caused very weird glitchs, there is a way to fix it by going to the settings and turning off multicore rendering, props has weird bugs that sometime they dont get case of lighting and instead of that they go black, even when you try to flashlight them doesnt do anything
SKYBOX - Theres 3D skybox on surface only but on xen you can only see 2D
NPC - When you see Tenacle for the first time you see the seientist for first time but the grabbing of him and dragging him back animation has been fixed, which still has issue in half-life
REFLECTIONS - sometimes maps have weird cubemaps issue, this sometime can cause by DX9. not sure if you have to change DX to 8.1 or something else. that crowbar reflections are also broken. again i not very sure if you have to change DX to 8.1 or something else
SOUNDS - Crowbar has problem with sounds, when hitting something such has wooden creates example it plays metal hitting sound instead, the reason is because the dev messed up their weapon script sound, there is still half-life 2 sounds which you can hear, you probably asking where can you hear it. you can hear it from your own footstep, doors, etc

thats all i could list, again if there is good and bad feature that i missed some then i cant add them because im too lazy to add one


[BUGS/DOWNGRADE FEATURES]

these bugs found by people, valve, others youtubes and by me


FONTS - Umlauts like ""ä,ö & ü"" do not exist in the German Version of Half-Life Source
WEAPONS - The zoom function is active. This was only active in HL1's multiplayer. The snark pickup uses the wrong model. It uses models/w_squeak.mdl instead of models/w_sqknest.mdl. The model is in the game files and should be used instead.
NPC - The scientist no longer commenting about smell and not just that If they afraid, a scientist can get stuck in a loop of trying to run away and playing a frightened animation. Barney glock's firerate is increased and his Kevlar vest doesn't reduce damage. Houndeyes hitboxes are offset, when they sleep, their eyelids dont shut and sometimes a loud screeching sound can be heard when they attack. HECU Helmets still protect them, but there's no sprite and leaves a flesh impact decal, decals can be painted on a HECU weapon, Dropped ammo and weapons arent set to the angle of their absolute origin, Impulse 76 does not work, instead the command attempts to spawn NPC_human_grunt. This fails, as the grunt is called monster_human_grunt and they do not fear M203 (MP5 Grenade Launcher). Apache have increased health, so it's taking more ammo to kill, Nihilanth some trampolines have a 'delay'. When walked over, they bounce after you're off them, in the fourth room the portal ball projectiles send you to, jumping to the teleporter in the ceiling may result in the player being teleported back into the same room instead of the Nihilanth pit. Sometimes repeatedly and finally barnacles tongues dont render correctly
MAPS - In c0a0b, the helicopter floats, In c0a0d, the robot walking into the radioactive materials resets its position into the air, In c1a0b, a scientist floats, at the start of ""We've Got Hostiles"" (c1a3d), the first soldier you see targets you instead of the scientist who had run down the stairs, at the start of ""We've Got Hostiles""(c1a3d), if you hurt the scientist who screams ""For god's sake open the silo doors..."" while standing in front of him, instead of running past you and through the tripmine, he will run to the security office door and it will open, allowing you to bypass the entirety of the ""We've Got Hostiles"" chapter if you desire, in c1a1f, when the scientist smashes the headcrab with the cabinet, no blood is displayed, In background_007, the scientist is invincible, and in the respective ""Blast Pit"" map(c1a4i), he has a chance to do the same, or not go and attack the Tentacles, In background_007, the scientist is invincible, and in the respective ""Blast Pit"" map(c1a4i), he has a chance to do the same, or not go and attack the tentacles, if holding a revolver in the transition from c2a3d to c2a3e, you will not spawn empty handed, in c2a4c, a really messed up shader pretty much makes it unplayable, causing severe graphical artifacts (the only way to fix it is by disabling multicore render in video settings) in c2a4d, the button to start the experiment can be pressed more than once, causing the experiment to go off more than once, in c2a5c, the skybox smears, in c4a2 to c4a2vb, the gonarch will not attack you, will not spawn baby headcrabs(or spawn very few), and when a projectile from it hits the ground, it creates a black box.
GENREAL - Some enemies do not spawn, corpses are static they should have been ragdolls instead. Materials are set to reflect a pre-made cubemap, this is not only unrealistic, but it also prevents level designers to use HDR if any reflecting HLS material is used.
Sometimes the flashlight glitches in the conveyor belt maze in chapter 10 (again the only way to fix it is by disabling multicore rendering) when climbing to the top of the ladder on the tank in chapter 13 (""Forget About Freeman!"") and jump, you will be flung up in the air and when starting a chapter with ""New Game"" all chapters are unlocked by default

note i very tried to list so thats all i could list

[FINAL THOUGHTS AND RATING]

the final thoughts that valve seriously doesnt care about this game alot, i glad its removed from the store and dead and i dont like about it much alot even people dont like it alot. before it was removed and you wanna know which one should you buy and ask your friend and he says ""Half-Life Source"" you buy it and found out they have bugs and look differents sometime you mad at you're friend. but before the 25th of half-life, the devs want to remove this game from the store. yes the game is still bug to this day and the game is still bad. my rating of this game is 1/10, also sometimes there is softlock in any campaign which doesnt have that feature in half-life 1 which is good but still this half-life source is bad",76561198828906433,Negative

176612916,730,"CSGO was one of the first games I've ever played, and I've watched it deteriorate throughout the release of CS2, into what it is now. If you like to play solo queue you either get a 4 stack in discord who ignores and trash talks you the whole game, or you get a bunch of randoms who have no care to play the game for the intended reason we do. To win. The game, just as many others is nothing but a tourist stop, you buy cases, or rent skins, show them off, and then lose constantly to people with less mental capabilities than a 3 year old. Trust me you could make the argument of joining groups and playing the game at a serious level but, if the casual gamer can't just log on to play one and have some form of team effort why is this game even a thing? The community is just as bad if not worse than LOL which is something very hard to achieve as that game itself has its own issues. Sad times for OG gamers.

Then, about 30 minutes into the game you will realize that the path finding is probably the absolute worst in any game you have ever played. The controls and operational methods are so inadequate and poor that you will wonder if this is the result of a bug (or many bugs), or even if the game has been installed correctly. Proceeding past the second mission without help is impossible. Because Darwinia does not explain itself to the player, you will be forced to search on Google for help and explanations, as this is the only way to make sense out of this presentational disaster. Further, because many aspects of the game are obscured by terrible presentation choices, you will feel as if the game does not allow you to play it. You will not know how to do several things that are required to achieve many of the mission objectives, thanks to the developer's choice in being vague and uninformative. The goals in Darwinia are explained so badly, that once again, I imagine that this portion of the game is also among the worst in any game I have played. The developers clearly did not have any care in designing a game that is intuitive, user friendly, and enjoyable. The feeling is that Darwinia is simply not complete, nor is it fully operable by the user. It is as if there are numerous amounts of game play that were not done to completeness, leaving the player at a loss and in frustration. In addition to the aforementioned problems, you can not save during a mission. The game does all the saving for you, after you complete each mission objective and at other seemingly random moments. This means, that you sometimes have to restart a mission from the very beginning, if something does not go according to plan. This is totally unacceptable. If the rest of the game was better suited, this saving problem would not bother me as much. The responsiveness of your units is atrocious. Ordering the units and Darwinians around is quite problematic, as they simply do not respond as they should, nor are they very useful to your commands. The processes required to order them around are tedious, slow, and unresponsive. They have such a difficult time maneuvering around the map, it's disgruntling. These shortcomings are so major, that enjoying the game as a whole is an arduous chore as you progress through the missions. Slowly, as you learn to endure Darwinia's league of problems, there are minor and sparse hints of quality gaming behind it all. Achieving the mission objectives as you hurdle past the developmental shortcomings and obstacles can give the player feelings of accomplishment and relief, since Darwinia is so inefficient and unfriendly. After all, this takes more work than it is fun. The creativity from the developers is undeniably present. The plot and storyline are original, going along well with the artwork and aesthetic style. Each map is basic, but they do have their stylistic charms. The missions can be repetitive, but at least they make sense in relation to the story. Unfortunately for the developers, creativity does not equal a quality product. There is a serious and widely known bug that will not allow you to deploy new units to the map, and the only way around it is to quit and restart the game. There are also some placement glitches that mysteriously do not allow you to deploy units. Darwinia is all about being an annoyance, a bother, a bore; a game with severe flaws that barely works or provides the player with anything remotely enjoyable. It is an incredibly tedious and inconvenient game. You 
will be spending your time and money better elsewhere.

Darwinia is bad.",76561197993304005,Negative

Pros:
Ability to play both sides
Great graphics, love the scenery in some levels, like the train station level
Teams are balanced
Combat is good
Gameplay is addicting

Cons:
The aiming for machine guns are kinda awkward as the gun moves upward when you fire, and you have to quickly reorient yourself and/or you could get killed while doing so.
The game is really hard when you first play it, but it becomes really fun and enjoyable once you get used to it and keep playing it; I guarantee ones who start to play it will want to keep playing.

166678877,440,"Okay serious time now, my actual critiques of the game is the matchmaking system, there should be no reason in hell that I am getting paired with 9 people who have 1k+ hours and we spend a whole session steamrolling people who only have maybe 10-20 hours in the game. It's borderline cursed and majorly just annoying when I want to feel a back and forth but all maps are just either red steamrolls blu or vice versa there is no actual balance for skill levels in this game to a point where it's depressing that some of these new players who don't know how to get votekicked end up using the bots as crutch sometimes just to actually keep up (of course until an actual skilled player comes in and kicks the bots) however it's just bad in general that matchmaking is like this. bots are an issue sure but tbh I'd rather have actual proper leveled match making vs whatever this is. and sure some people may get off on bullying new players but I don't I'd rather see the new players actually flourish vs play one game or two then get steamrolled all those games and still wonder what even was the right class pick vs actually being able to say wow I had fun and learned where I went wrong. I've known a good amount of people who outright quit because they're still confused as to if they've improved or not even changed in terms of skill level for this game because the matches they got slapped into are these steamroll sessions where either A they get carried or B they get flattened. There is no median. But yes that is my actual qualms with this game and I feel that even if the bots were removed it still wouldn't change the vanilla issues in the game with casual matchmaking.",76561198130055705,Negative

58688580,550,"Unless you have friends at your disposal or actual good players at your side, this game will be impossible. Sure, you can be a pussy and choose the easiest difficulty, but instead your experience will become dull and lifeless (Pun not intended).

If opting out for single player, though, you're also out of luck. The AI in this game is...something else. Incompetent? Not always. Better than real players? Maybe, but not all the time. At least with real players, you can interact with them, at the cost of varying skill levels and, well, helpfulness. More on that later.

This game feels like it has a steep learning curve, much like TF2. The problem with this game is that TF2 has a charm and charisma that makes you coming back for more (even if you played like dog shit), making you spend time and effort to get to everyone's level. This game? It barely has any of that, and it doesn't really make you feel like you made an impact in your skills. Plus, you'll feel like a burden or dead weight to your team starting out, and they'll just complain about how sucky you are when they aren't seeing YOUR side of the book (much like TF2 in earlier days). 

And since this game requires legitimate teamwork, having real imbalance in skill at the game doesn't help, especially when you're considered the dead weight. It's just not fun. 

I'll admit that I never played the original L4D, but I really wanted to play this one out of popularity (and for that cheap, small sale). 

Gem, if you're seeing this, I'm sorry.

There's genuinely a lot to like about the game, but there's enough about it that I find unpleasant enough to spoil my enjoyment.  Throughout the game there is a ton of dialogue from GlaDoS and a lot of it is bitter, petty and mean.  It gets old very fast and grates.  Wheatley the other main character also gets old fast.  I just want to mute the dialogue and get rid of the plot entirely and just do the puzzles.

The puzzles are mostly good but there are too many instances where its less about puzzling something out, and more about being lucky enough to notice some obscure distant surface you need to portal to.  This also gets old fast.",76561198273485459,Negative

178960520,550,"Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolute gem in the world of cooperative gaming. It builds upon the success of the original Left 4 Dead and amps up the action, intensity, and fun factor to new heights. The game brings together an engaging mix of horror, strategy, and teamwork, and it’s easy to see why it has a dedicated fan base even years after its release.

One of the best aspects of Left 4 Dead 2 is its pacing and unpredictability. The AI “Director” adjusts the zombie spawns, item placements, and difficulty on the fly, which means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. This keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, even after hours of play. Plus, each of the four survivors has a unique personality and sense of humor that makes the experience feel engaging and immersive.

The level design in Left 4 Dead 2 is fantastic. Each campaign is visually distinct and full of atmosphere, taking you through dark swamps, abandoned cities, and eerie amusement parks. The diverse environments keep players on their toes, with plenty of memorable moments and intense chokepoints.

Adding to the challenge and fun are the special infected zombies, which require strategy and teamwork to deal with. Facing a Tank or Witch in a tight corridor with low ammo can be absolutely terrifying, and it forces players to work together in order to survive.

The multiplayer experience is where Left 4 Dead 2 truly shines. Whether you’re playing in co-op with friends or competing in Versus mode, the game offers hours of replayability. The community is still active, and with the modding support on PC, there are countless custom maps and game modes available, which extend the game’s lifespan even further.

Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. The blend of tension, humor, and strategy makes it a game that’s not only fun to play but also brings people together. If you enjoy action-packed, cooperative gameplay and don’t mind the occasional jump scare, Left 4 Dead 2 is absolutely worth playing.",76561199152424579,Positive

160309521,240,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE

Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",76561198970337661,Positive

163901793,730,"I recently returned to playing CS2 after a long pause, and unfortunately, my experience was marinated by cheating. I played a total of three games, with the first being a premiere match. Despite my friends warning me about the prevalence of cheaters, I was skeptical until I witnessed it firsthand. During the warm-up, the opposing team typed 'hvh' in the chat, which stands for 'hack versus hack.' I had hoped it was just a troll, but unfortunately, one of the players had a rage cheat that allowed him to take out our entire team with a single shot from a Desert Eagle.

I decided to play two more games, this time in competitive mode, after my friends assured me that cheating was less prevalent in that game mode. However, we only managed to win couple rounds in those TWO GAMES. Upon reviewing the replays, it was clear that the opposing team was using wallhacks to aim at our heads without even attempting to conceal their cheating. I thought Valve had announced the release of VAC 2.0, but it seems it's not yet available to combat these issues.

Based on my recent experiences, I firmly believe that without significant improvements to the anti-cheat system from Valve, the game is essentially unplayable.",76561198025428651,Negative

The simplicity of the game makes it unique because everything else tries to have a gimmick. It is a Source game so it has lots of community servers with unique maps and different game modes like zombies, but the game shines best as just two teams fighting over a town. 

Some say the game has developed a strange community of crazy power abusing Boomers in its twilight years, but the reality is that Day of Defeat has always been populated by such people.

180059319,730,"The Game is Great 10/10 would get abused in office again. Also Here is an amazing pecan pie recipe made by Chat GPT:

Ingredients:
For the Pie Crust:

1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
½ teaspoon salt
1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, cold and cubed
2-4 tablespoons ice water
For the Pecan Pie Filling:

1 cup light corn syrup (or dark corn syrup for a richer flavor)
1 cup packed brown sugar
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
4 large eggs
1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
½ teaspoon salt
2 cups pecan halves (or chopped pecans if you prefer)
Instructions:
Prepare the Pie Crust:

In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt.
Add the cold, cubed butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough just comes together (you may need 2-4 tablespoons of water).
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it a couple of times to bring it together. Form it into a disk.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes to chill.
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
After chilling, roll out the dough on a floured surface to fit your pie dish. Transfer the dough to the dish and trim any excess. Crimp the edges or press with a fork to decorate.
Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the paper and weights and bake for another 5 minutes until lightly golden. Set aside to cool.
Prepare the Filling:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth.
Fold in the pecans. Ensure the nuts are evenly distributed in the filling.
Assemble and Bake the Pie:

Pour the pecan filling into the pre-baked pie crust.
Bake the pie for 50-60 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. You can check doneness by gently shaking the pie—there should be no wobble in the center.
If the crust is browning too quickly, cover the edges with aluminum foil to prevent over-baking.
Cool and Serve:

Let the pecan pie cool completely at room temperature before slicing. This helps the filling set for perfect slices.
Serve as is, or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for extra indulgence!
Tips:
Corn Syrup Substitute: If you want a more natural option, you can use maple syrup instead of corn syrup, though the texture and flavor will be a bit different.
To Toast the Pecans: For extra flavor, toast the pecans in a dry skillet over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, or bake them in the oven at 350°F for 8-10 minutes until fragrant. Allow them to cool before adding to the filling.
Chill the Dough: This is crucial to prevent shrinking when baking the pie crust. You can also use store-bought pie dough for a quicker option.
Enjoy your homemade pecan pie! It’s sure to become a favorite!",76561198852228928,Positive

Most of the enemies deal damage based on hit-registration as oppose to any dodgable alternative. This leads to the most dull gunfights, hugging covers and quick peaking. Additionally, this game has the strongest auto-aim feature in any game I have played thus far. The only improvement over the other entries is the soundtrack. Which barely increased, compared to the previous entry. The story might also be the weakest of all the entries and you can really feel it drag on, without you having proper motivation to continue.

7646384,550,"Compaired to Left 4 Dead one its the same old crap, different day. This time just with an AI director that has the mind of a general, that unfairly spawns zombies behind you constantly just to screw you  and he never lets up either, especially when you have low health.

and he spawns them even from your own safe room that you only just stepped 20 feet out of 10 seconds ago at the start of the map... along with zig zagging zombies.


like a zombies would have enough cognitive function left in his brain to do that... and regular zombies no less. 

Not the experenced survivors turned zombies like in the passing DLC or special zombies like you would think would MAYBE do that because of former experence that transfered over when they were alive as humans, but no, instead its regular joe blow zombies that do that and it doesnt even follow a logical patern either. 

like say they only do that when a flashlight is shined at them, like an animal would probably do, or rather wouldnt do actually, like a deer caught in someones headlights.  

and all of this is stuff that didnt used to happen in the original either.....

which is made it so much more fun over this one before they screwed that up too with their game balancing tweaks after release with it. like having the walls break in on the old maps that didnt used to do that. 

The most proment example of that being the elevator on No Mercy and the solid stone wall breaking like its paper mache on The Lighthouse Level thus making these sections far less fun than they used to be, and If I could I WOULD revert all of those changes in the orignal and just play that instead of this one. 



So in conclusion I'm glad I only paid 5 bucks for it on sale and I only bought it as a ""might as well"" deal as L4D 3 has already been confirmed.

so the prinicpal of the boycott on this is long since its due date and yes I was a member of that, as I loved the original that much and I was highly insulted when they dropped support for it just to make a sequel with it.

and then used the first one as a test subject for the above annoying modifications to it, and theres not even an option to swtich the AI behavior and the map designs back to how they used to be. 

and also valve I know you tracked the people in the boycott to see who did and didnt buy this game   and I only did it because of the above reason, I still stand behind what I said and feel about the original. 

and so far you havent written that wrong yet, you'd have to de modify and put L4D 1 back to what it was before I'd consider that rectified and righted, So its not a bad game, but its easy to see why people went balisitic over it coming out so soon after Left 4 Dead 1 and why some of us clinged to that boycott and the principals behind it.

Basically with Left 4 Dead 2, think Arham City to Arkham Origins, with them modifying city with the stuff from origins to make it worse and you've got L4D 1 and 2 in a nutshell. 

with the same slap in the face that they did with the Joker in Origins, tricking people into thinking it wasnt all about the joker that time around when in fact it was. 


and I'd apply that to them saying this is better than L4D one and that it's a completely new game.

As the only major improvements are the inclement weather in Heavy rain and the inclusion of the Melee weapons in it, namely with the chainsaw that reminds me heavily of doom 3 and makes me wish it had unlimited fuel with it. Just so I could use it for the entire level to see how effective it would be against all of the special zombies.

and maybe to get a chainsaw charlie achevement in the next one if they think of that or actually read this review. 

but all of that could have been added to Left 4 Dead one without fiddling with it and ruining the zombie AI along with ruining the level design, so its two positives vs two negatives 

and honestly if I could vote this as a neutral rating I would, but since I cant and I remember how much I loved the original before they screwed with it, it gets a stamp of not recommended.

and to give you an idea of how much more I loved that game originally over this one, I put 89 hours in L4D 1, and only 18 in this once I finished up the achevements 

and weirdly editing this review and everything I felt and wanted to say about this has actually bumped that time up to 19 hours now.",76561197971762816,Negative

They will do but not limited to.

Doxing you (they'll even use those bot to spread your doxed information in game)
Swating
Impersonating you with the use of AI mimicking your voice saying racist and homophobic shit and have it be spammed in game by those same Bots by the way.

174490396,70,"Let me preface this review with something important: YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME!
It is an integral piece of gaming history. This is a must play, even if I have a personal disdain for it, because it's just that core to gaming as a hobby and medium. Now onto why, even though you should play this game, I found it to be miserable. 


Compared to more modern source games, this game absolutely does not hold up. Enemies are bullet sponges and movement feels like Quake but worse. Way too slippery with too many sections that demand some precision, so even if you get some Bhops going, you have to lose momentum because of needing to make a stupidly specific jump. I generally enjoy many old games (Doom, Morrowind, BG1, etc). However, the movement and enemies just had me raging like crazy. On a rail, power up, surface tension, forget about freeman (Screw that portal puzzle), and multiple other levels are all hot garbage that im still befuddled as to how they got through QA. Just in general, the second half of this game is absolute garbage, worse than the post twist gameplay sections of BioShock, which also happen to have stupidly spongy enemies. 


Bottom line is, you should play this game, id even argue its an obligation. HOWEVER play it on ez mode with console if needed instead of trudging through a higher difficulty on low hp, quick loading and saving every 2 seconds like I did, you could also play the community made remaster, Black Mesa.",76561198083303256,Negative

25668870,240,Graphics are good but like DODS it's impractical.  Game is constantly granting ridiculous headshots and has too many exploits which to this day developer hasn't corrected. It also possesses too many public servers with unethical administrators whom allow cheating and are engaging in it themselves.  They bind to a key and toggle it off and on.  I witness it regularly on popular public servers and clans do nothing about it.  Late at night I've caught many of the administrators doing it.  Valve should go in and clean house with this kind of thing and they do nothing.  It's killing morale and quite frankly chasing away gamers. After reviewing this product and others like it it's my unequivocal opinion the gamers and developers are a clandestine circle of corruption. Keeping in constant close contact beneath the radar and functioning as one on multiple platforms like raccoons.  In hindsight it is a little funny because a lot of you are quite dumb and have self esteem issues.  You use the games as a way to make up for life's shortcomings.

166989110,440,"Okay so I spent far too much time with this game. I've played since 2008 (I think) and it's been a love/hate relationship for me. Frequently quitting, returning, and quitting again. On one hand I recognize how great of game it is for many reasons that others have said better than I could. But on the other hand I've been unlucky to have a lot of bad experiences with this game. Even before valve started neglecting it. Toxic players, trolls, scammers, and just plain bad luck has plagued my tf2 experience since day 1. I've had some good moments of course, but its mostly been bad. But maybe that's just my negativity bias.

But I don't want to bore readers with my personal experiences and complaints, and just say I'm finally done with this game. I'm tired, and I don't care anymore. Clearly Valve doesn't care either. Everyone has said it already, but the bot crisis has been a problem for half a decade now, and the most we got from valve is a tweet. (Or an X now I guess,) But there's still over 200,000 people who want to #fixTF2, and despite my own grievances with the game, I would feel guilty if I didn't offer at least a small amount of support.

So I signed the petition, and I'm posting this long review that people will unlikely read. But that's okay. I'm mostly doing this for myself. As a way to get some closure for a game that was once a big part of my gaming life. Valve, if you really care about your fans, you will fix TF2 and CS2 as well as they have bot problems too. And to players reading this, I wish the best for you all. Keep up the fight, and don't let the fire die out.

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2019 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there’s fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

172108357,1700,"Note: The game did not record my playtime accurately, when I started up the game it starts up a ""program32"" window that seems to count as the game but I usually closed that early on and played the game so I actually have about 40 hours of playtime.

This game has all of the old RPG jank you could expect and MORE but it's still fun enough to put up with until you get used to it. When I first started the game I was baffled by the control scheme, I did not like it. The first enemy was hard because fighting the controls was harder than the enemy, but one you get used to the weird and janky controls it plays just fine and I made few mistakes. 

The combat is slow and methodical but still engaging and decently fun. For example, if you liked Morrowind combat, this is like that but better because the hit boxes are much better and you can actually hit things you aim at. Once you realize power attacks are the way to go, combat flows pretty well. 

The sound design however, is another story. So the sound is mostly fine, however some sounds are seriously messed up. Specifically sounds from the lighting bolt spells and magic missile spells are SO FUCKING LOUD regardless of your settings. You can turn the SFX down to 1 and turn the application volume to 5 and the sounds of a lightning bolt will still be so loud it feels like it's at a normal volume while everything else is barely audible. So if you have the volume at a normal volume the lightning bolts will damn near blow you ears out. This was so jarring in combat and even got me killed a few times while I tried playing with the volume options in combat. Luckily, enemies that use these spells are few and far between. You generally needn't worry about it.

The story is decently interesting, I wasn't compelled to skip every cutscene and dialogue because the content was interesting enough. The idea of the sun simply going out one day, forcing the survivors to retreat underground is an interesting concept, but unfortunately it isn't used as anything more than a plot device to drive the antagonist forward, it isn't really explored, at least not in a mainstream way, as I didn't read every single lore tome in the game and I shouldn't have to for me to understand more about such an important fact of the universe. The story does have some interesting machinations and characters, and I think there were some revelations and character dynamics that were pretty interesting and entertaining. I just wish the sun going out was explored more.

The magic is implemented in a unique and interesting way, but I really think the game would have benefited from options to streamline the casting system for people like me who didn't want to bother with having to accurately draw each rune every time I cast a spell. An option to instead type a series of numbers corresponding to the runes for casting a spell or buttons on a controller would have made the magic more accessible. It did feel good to memorize the runes for spells and get used to casting common spells like Speed to move around faster, but I never even bothered trying to cast in combat because the prospect of trying to complete a rune sequence mid combat was not fun. It can also be frustrating to draw out runes over and over hoping the game deigns to bless you with the charitable act of allowing the letter ""G"" you drew to actually count as the rune and let you cast the spell.

The progression of the game is pretty good overall and I like the progression of power, you feel like you're getting powerful at a steady rate and are able to tackle the challenges ahead of you. This is, until the final part of the game when you fight the damn Ylside warriors, which buff themselves to attack faster, deal more damage, and move faster, and the increased movement speed means you can't rely on the hit and run tactics you've been employing the entire game, and they can also shred your health bar. Even with the best gear in the game up to the point you're at and with a tank build I could barely take on a single Ylside warrior at a time, often chugging healing potions (which there is a finite number of these in the game, like every item as shops only refresh their inventory at 2 or 3 points in the game, if even that) just to not get killed. They are so damn strong and hard to kill all the way up until you get the strongest weapon in the game and even then they will still make you chug a few healing potions. This is until you get their armor, which makes you able to easily tank them, but you don't get this until you are literally one room away from the 
 final boss. 

Over the game is fun and def worth the price, I paid under $2 for it and even not on sale I think it's worth it. If you like older RPGs or want to try one out, I think it aged well enough and is worth playing.

10436850,630,"It was a couple of summers ago. A friend and I had nothing to do, and we got bored of the usual few games that we engage ourselves with: Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and so on. We ran out of things to play with empty wallets as well. We were students, merry, but poor, and then we saw this new free-to-play game on steam known as Alien Swarm. No harm giving it a try, right? Little did we know that we will be spending the whole of our summer rolling around a blue-themed spaceship setting aliens ablaze. 

Alien Swarm is not a big project or game in particular, or so to speak. There is only one campaign of 7 maps to choose from, and the game itself gets repetitive in the long run. Still, what makes this game fun and captivative is the co-operative nature of this game and the array of weapons the game offers. Choosing the right class and weapon will be highly beneficial for the game play as having the right setups will shorten or lengthen the gameplay by up to 10 minutes, and there will be a drastic difference in reward as well. Since this game uses a leveling system, it will mean that one of the best case scenario is to look for a map where you can do quick runs (in a minute or two) over and over again so as to accumulate the largest amount of experience in the shortest time possible. 

One thing I am found of for free-to-play games developed and published by valve, especially Alien Swarm in particular, is that there are no micro-marketing. Meaning, every single item in game are attainable through a little bit of hard work and grinding. It’s free, and if you have the time to spare, what’s your reason for not trying?

31070212,130,"""Half-Life: Blue Shift"" is the second expansion pack for the acclaimed ""Half-Life"". Offering little new content, it is usually considered a lesser expansion pack than ""Half-Life: Opposing Force"" - and I've gotta say I understand this. There are no new weapons in ""Blue Shift"", and no new enemies. Still, it is a fun little game (it has a mere 8 chapters) with quite a lot of interesting easter eggs, a Gordon Freeman sighting near the very beginning and some interesting maps. And let's not forget that it is the first game in the Half-Life series to feature consistent interaction with a single non-player character. This character, as you may know, is Dr. Rosenberg. ""Blue Shift"" might not be the most exciting Half-Life game, but it sure is a fun and interesting experience, perhaps mostly for Half-Life geeks like myself.",76561198366722029,Positive

71592740,340,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a short demo originally released to showcase and demonstrate the new capabilities of the updated Source engine, primarily its High Dynamic Range (HDR) feature.

Originally meant to be a part of the chapter Highway 17 in the main Half-Life 2 release, this ride will last you about ten minutes.

This was Valve's first ""game"" to include the commentary nodes, and these are very interesting, as always.

179081220,20,"This game, without a doubt, stands as one of the most awe-inspiring and visually stunning achievements in the history of gaming. From the moment you step into its intricately designed world, it becomes immediately clear that the developers have poured their hearts and souls into crafting an experience that doesn’t just look good but transcends the medium, effectively transporting players into a bygone era. The graphical fidelity on display here is nothing short of revolutionary. The hyper-realistic shaders are not just aesthetically pleasing—they redefine what’s possible in gaming graphics. Every surface, every material, and every light source interacts with a level of realism that makes you feel as though you've stepped through a portal into 1939.

The lighting system is an absolute marvel, with rays of sunlight piercing through clouds in a way that feels tangible, casting dynamic shadows that shift as time progresses. Textures, too, are painstakingly detailed, down to the smallest crack in the pavement or the weathering on a wooden door. The environmental design is so authentic that you can almost smell the rain-soaked cobblestones or feel the warmth of a sunlit café terrace. It’s a level of immersion that’s so convincing it blurs the lines between reality and digital artistry. Few games in history have managed to reach this level of detail, and this title sets a new standard for what can be achieved in gaming. The painstaking care with which every frame has been designed ensures that players will find themselves pausing, not out of necessity but simply to admire the visual splendor unfolding around them.

Beyond its graphical prowess, this game also redefines gameplay by introducing a fresh and innovative system centered around distinct character classes. This addition is nothing short of a game-changer, offering an unprecedented level of depth and strategy to the experience. Unlike traditional formats where gameplay can become predictable after a few matches, the implementation of unique classes ensures that every match feels different and exciting. Players are no longer limited to simply swapping teams every dozen rounds or cycling through an uninspired arsenal of weapons. Instead, they are presented with an array of carefully designed characters, each equipped with their own abilities, strengths, and playstyles. Whether you prefer the brute force of a tank-like enforcer, the tactical precision of a sniper, or the ingenuity of a support specialist, there’s a class to match every playstyle and strategy.

This new layer of strategic gameplay adds a refreshing complexity that keeps players engaged, encouraging experimentation and adaptation. It’s not just about winning—it’s about mastering the nuances of each class, coordinating with teammates, and outsmarting opponents in ways that feel deeply satisfying. The result is a game that feels perpetually fresh, rewarding, and brimming with opportunities for creativity and skillful play. No two matches are ever the same, and this dynamic variety ensures that the experience never grows stale, no matter how many hours you invest.

This game is not merely a piece of entertainment; it is a monumental artistic achievement and a testament to the boundless potential of interactive media. It represents the perfect marriage of cutting-edge technology, visionary design, and deep, engaging gameplay. Few games in history have managed to achieve such a harmonious balance between technical brilliance and artistic expression, and this title is undoubtedly one of them. Its ability to captivate players, both visually and emotionally, elevates it far beyond the realm of ordinary games. It is a cultural artifact, a work of art that will be remembered for years to come as a shining example of what the medium can accomplish.

Given its groundbreaking contributions to the industry, it is unquestionably deserving of recognition as a Game of the Year contender in 2025. To ignore or overlook this game would be a gross injustice and a glaring example of how disconnected awards organizations can sometimes be from the true masterpieces of our time. This game is not just a benchmark for future titles—it is a beacon of innovation, creativity, and excellence. It deserves to be celebrated, cherished, and remembered as one of the most extraordinary games ever made.

In every aspect, this game stands head and shoulders above its peers, delivering an experience that is nothing short of magical. It has redefined what games can be, and if there is any justice in the world of gaming, this title will not just be remembered but will also inspire future generations of developers to dream bigger, aim higher, and push the boundaries of what is possible. Without a doubt, this game is an unparalleled masterpiece, a work of art that will stand the test of time.",76561199386322568,Positive

167750148,730,"It's easily the best competitive game. However it's only as long as you don't meet cheaters, and right now that's impossible in CS2. It's completely infested with cheaters, even more so than in CSGO. The only way to enjoy this game to some extent with LESS cheaters, is through faceit. The devs only care about pro level games, and casual players who play 2 hours a month and buy skins, but give the middle finger to their core community, who love and play the game on a daily/weekly basis. None of the in-game matchmaking options are viable. If your elo grows up to 20k in premier, you'll meet cheaters once every 2 games, and the higher you get, the more you meet them. You'll even meet spinbots in deathmatch servers.

The elo system in premier is completely broken. If you lose more than 1 game in a row, you'll start losing insane amounts of points per game (first -100, then -300, then -500, etc.) and the only way to start winning lots of points, is by winning lots of consecutive games, which is next to impossible due to hackers. Not to mention that even if you're 13k elo, you can be matched against 20k elo players despite the game boasting +1 million playerbase, and the skill difference is massive. (Your elo is not considered in the points system, only consecutive wins matter, in other words if you're 13k elo and you play against +20k elo players, you still lose the same points) So good luck with that.

So if you don't already own the game, don't bother before the game gets an anti cheat. Right now we only have a logo of ""VAC"" which stands for ""Valve Allows Cheats"". If you still want to play CS, go play faceit. That's the only way to keep your hair. Even there you will still meet hackers who have bought subscription based cheats, but at least they're rather rare.

I've been playing CS since 1999, play in faceit lvl 10 games, and have +5,5k hours since csgo alone, so I'd like to think I have a reasonably good picture of the game's current state.",76561197960967428,Negative

45751373,550,"I have many zombie games and this one is pretty exciting, but it gets real boring and bland fast, since it has many character cosmetic mods but not a lot of maps or play areas. Or game type mods

Great graphics high fps, smooth on ultra, shadows etc. Good godrays, EAX sound, 3d audio, high performance are smooth, no stuttering , good detailed textures, real looking for the time era game was made.

 The pace of the game is very good and fun, but the hit boxes are terrible. I thought that it was because of bad ping but after I hosted my own solo I realized it was not due to bad ping.  Hunters can actually bug out and glitch through walls when they auto lock on , same as jockeys.  Chargers have a large 5 feet melee hit box farther than its mesh and animation file. So they are teleporting.

 I know this because I tested it numerous times and recorded it and saw it again in slower frame slow mo cam. I saw I killed the charger but seconds later when there is no enemies near me I see that it register its hit after the fact that it died and it died 5 feet away from me. So this is the devs way of being lazy with priorities and cutting corners.  Also the bots are terrible, even games created in 2004 have better Ai.

  Pvp is ok, but its still unbalanced IMO. co op is fun but there are plenty of toxic trolling around, however once in a while you can make friends real quick and there are nice community. Even so I think its worth playing but not worth keeping around. 

 The characters are lame and they make lame jokes while they are fighting, which is irritating if you have 3d audio EAX card. This tech is used to scout mode foot steps of enemies and you can hear them coming even if they are 20 feet away sneaking behind you. But you can't use this because the characters will not STFU with repeat jokes.   

 Thrown object projectiles are terrible, there is a number of physics bugs and glitches also exploits.  There are infinite range attacks sometimes if you are a smoker zombie you have a tongue that has infinite range... also can go through trucks and cars ( not window) . It is very immersion breaking especially on competitive round game types, not to mention annoying, cheap and griefing.   My friend was once able to grab a player enemy with the tongue and throw them off the map to instant KO people.  Zombies are overpowered this way.   Also you can see through trees and bushes.
 Overall: 
Graphics 9/10  very good graphics for the time period, superb shading rendering/ shadows etc.

Characters: 1/ 10    (boring stupid people you can't relate to, bad fashion, need mods to configure looks, also sometimes mods crash or unstable, or can't use multiple fashions or character changes since plugins conflict .) 
mods: 7/10  no load orders is bad mods system. But mods look great .

Story: 1/10  no real story, something about the flu mutating and that it is not the flu, and CEDA, and military blah blah, no scientific back story about virus or whatever, was it aliens? was it outbreak worldwide? Cliché,  just go in and mindlessly kill stuff.

Performance: 9/10 game runs well even on ultra settings very good fps stable. low system requirements

gameplay: 4/10 game types lacking, and not fun IMO, i have more fun with other games.

community :  5/10  I seen better, also trolls on PvE team griefing, throwing propane tanks on friends, I had fair share of team killing for griefing players as well.

weapons 1/10  shit for brains, 7.62 has .22 damage. and 5.56 have 9.19 damages.  no iron sights, boring weapons, no customizations, shit accuracy even point blank with shotguns. Ballistic projectiles have glitches infinite range. Lack of weapon choices, weapons look gawd ugly, animations for reloads and shooting are shit. Grenade launchers do shit damage. shotguns are ok, but has infinite range and shit accuracy. not a lot of weapons to choose from, some melee 

weapons: katana, baseball bat, crowbar, plywood cricket bat, chainsaw
range: DMR, m16, ak, uzi mac, pistol
cqb: spas12 mos500, autoshotgun
Thrown: bile bomb, pipebomb, molotov

bugs 1/10   found lotta bugs even when I first started playing. collision bugs, projectile bugs, physics bugs, hit box bugs, teleporting special infected lock on enemies ( verified with slow mo record) saw hunter jump through a wall , then through a crowd , then through an elevator to get a player who was clearly pro and dodging and anticipating the attack... very cheap to punish a skilled player, using noobs and noob exploits.

anti cheat 6/10  meh... pple dont cheat you cant cheat in the game but the rules are bonked , reasons why, are already explained with the balancing, exploits, and hit boxes.

bots 1/10    shit for brains Ai, I can think of so many other games with better bots with better priority triggers and reactions. Bots will waste resources and will not refill ammo or throw grenades or do anything tactical but get in the way and watch your team die. They will do stupid things like revive a team mate when they should be clearing the room first, so they end up overrun by the time they helped a team mate- causing themselves and everyone to die.. Their priorities are very poor in judgement. They ignore commands for help when there is special infected incapaciting a team mate. They run in front of you while your spraying full auto, they don’t crouch when they run in front of you. They don’t melee, but you can use mods to mitigate that stupidity.  

meh game... style and fashion is average joe stupid, you can't get armor or make / find protective gear, even after you killed a bunch of armored Kevlar zombies you think you would at least be able to pick up their riot gear right?
 you can’t make Molotov’s you have to find them instead, really? like what’s with all the beer on the map and I can't make a Molotov?

 You can't sprint in the game, you have to play as a fat ass American who can't run. Meanwhile some zombies sprint faster than a motorcycle, and they can jump down 4 story tall buildings unharmed, but you can bash them once with a crowbar and they die... makes sense? no, these devs got @#!t for brains go play killing floors or seven days to die instead.

But they did get one crucial game play element right: fast pace adrenaline shooter.
IF they make L4D3 and they rebalance and deal with these issues, it would be a perfect good game, and I would recommend it. But given that it is now an old game, I don't think they are going to work on fixing it.",76561198013549427,Negative

12219282,630,"Alien Swarm is an interesting game. Interesting in the way it plays, and the ideas behind it. When it first came out, it was expected to be a simple base for people to mod with. Not an uncommon feature for a game, since there are games just for modding like Gary's Mod. Yet, Alien Swarm didn't change that much once released. The community didn't mod it, and those that did never made much head way.

But thats beside the point. The game is great for some fun times. The co-op campaign is fun, and having someone there to cover your back is nice. Aliens come from everywhere. From the vents, holes, cliffs, even a few test tubes on certain levels. You can spot some entry points easily, but always be ready to turn around and fire after a few seconds. Aliens also tend to swarm you from behind if you move too slow. The game is meant to be a run and gun through the hordes of aliens, often running back once you reach a dead end. It also offers a nice variety of aliens, from the standard minion to the hulking tanks. Each mission is unique, and always challenging when played again.

The only downside is that finding a group to play with is a bit hard. While the game is free, very few people stick with it. For many it will be a simple beat the campaign, and move on game.

Overall the game is pretty fun, especially if there is any nostalgia feel for you. The game plays almost exactly like Half-Life 1, with the environment, weapons, enemies, and almost everything being the same as Half-Life 1 (DUH its the same time). There aren't as many creative ways to finish some of the levels and overall Half-Life Blue Shift is a bit less complex and a whole lot shorter.

It was a fun game to play with friends for a session, but I hadn't really looked back on the game since. However, I recognise the impact this game had on the internet. This game is BY FAR one of the most iconic video games in history, simply because of the memes, communities and players that were summoned because of this game. This realisation is apparently far more than what Valve are doing, as they don't give a single shit about this game and it shows. The game is being stampeded with bots, hackers and whatnot, and yet, Valve are refusing to do ANYTHING. They are clearly aware of this. There is no way they haven't seen ""FixTF2"" on the internet and there is no way they haven't realised what people are saying about this game. Even if you do not believe any of these things, Valve put out a statement a while ago, saying that they were going to fix this issue. Try to guess the outcome of that.

I believe I can say for a lot of people that this game is important to the gaming community. Seeing it crack, crumble and crash like this is genuinely saddening, and I can't see this happen any longer to a game this special. Please Valve, #FixTF2.",76561198796415089,Negative

155087882,570,"Here's the deal: Dota 2 is a terrific game and a terrible gaming experience.  What do I mean? Read on curious reader.

If you are not aware Dota 2 is a 5 vs 5 Multiplayer Online Battle Area (MOBA) there are many like it but its daddy DotA (Defense of the Ancients) was the first big one alllll the way back in the prehistoric days of Warcraft 3.  Dota 2 took the old custom map from that 20 year old game and updated it for the modern age. Slick, crisp, clean and mean Dota 2 looks, sounds and feels pretty good to play. That is until you actually play against other humans

You see, in Dota 2 you'll be piloting one of many, many, MANY different heroes. They are each unique, fit into various roles and damage types, and offer a variety of nukes, stuns, slows, freezes, and so much more gobbledegook that the beginner player will need to sort through and memorize.

This is point one on why I do not recommend Dota 2.  Its requirement for memorization. The player needs to know upgrade paths, build orders, the skills of all other champions in the game as well as counters, each powers effective distance, whether a stun is instand or delayed, attack speeds, animation cancels, costs of items and where they spawn, unit and sub-unit controls, walk speeds, what can be  jumped/flashed/pushed through on top of or not and so, so much more.  The sheer amount of STUFF you have to commit to memory and have off the top of your noggin at any moment is outrageous.  Dota 2 isnt beginner unfriendly. Its beginner hateful. 

Point 2 : the community
Since you need to know so much, and be ready to switch builds/goals quickly the community is quite intolerant of players that dont have their Dota Dissertation memorized. Missteps, gaffes, or doing something someone else doesnt like or deems is wrong proceeds the player into the bout of name calling, shouting, griefing, and throwing of the game. Someone becomes a scapegoat when games start to falter, and the death spiral for the match quickly comes into frame. This is at the core of what Dota 2 is. 

If you can tolerate the toxic community, or have a core group of 5 people to play with, then  the game can be quite rewarding. finding a couple champs that really work for you, or dedicating the time to memorize all the minutiae the game has on hand can really get the seratonin dripping.  Should the player wade through the muck there is gold to be found here. And its free, an added bonus. 

However, for any and all newcomers Dota 2 is obfuscation ontop of griefing wrapped in frustration and confusion. Its not a game for anyone not already playing it despite its pricetag. Still better than League though.",76561198028674152,Negative

This is a half-baked sandbox with a lot of lazy conventions, huge empty spaces (often without a sane background) and COMPLETELY disabled enemy AI on cheap scripts. Also, Helicopter Bosses with infinite mines, oppressive one-hole gameplay in vehicle missions and hordes of useless friendly NPCs from the CallOfDuty circus.  

* Manhack drones in collectors ARE EXTREMELY GOOD. Headcrab Shells on civilians ARE DRAMATICALLY good. The tunnels before the Citadel don't look too bad, to be honest (better - in Episode One). 

Physics - just a HAVOK-engine with issues when three bricks balance the protagonist on a swing. Puzzles are squalid in most. 
Graphics - good water, but FarCry1 is already there; not bad flames, but Unreal2 is already there; poor empty landscapes; awkward architecture with cheap textures; bad models and body-textures except for 2-3 faces; bad animations except for 2-3 faces. 
Story - the plot is not revealed, means ""mocking_disregard""; characters are flat; feigned dialogues are just disgusting. First part of walkthrogh is boring, second part is more sickening than CallOfDuty. Look, out of a 5h30mins walktrough in total - 35mins of Airboat-mission, 35mins of Buggy-mission (and the Bridge), only 20mins of Ravenholm, 35mins of Prison_CoD_bullsh!t, 1h15mins of Urban_CoD_bullsh!t and 25mins of Citadel.

16021671,280,"im shocked frankly!
How did they fuck up a game i played so much as a teen!
back in the day when i was just a weeee little 13 year old, i used to pirate half life, 
after a while my grandparents bought me half life source and death match source, and i liked it, i got this game right around the time freeman's mind was coming out, 
the game was good i liked it, it was stable looked nice, and ran decently on my shitty hp pavilion slimline running vista, 
then my account got hacked and i lost the game, 
now year's later im 21 and decided to buy this game again to relive some old memories, 
i shouldn't have, this game has some how along the line gotten worse, what was once a decently put together game ported to the source engine is broken, 
so here are some good and bad additions, 
THEY FINALLY ADDED THE HD PACK! 
bad news, 
they added the HD pack. 
took them long enough but its worse than anything, textures look strange and inconsistent, the hev suite has wear on it, and so do all the armor on the barneys. 
Sounds are missing from various weapons when you turn it on, 
They never fixed the crow bar making one sound on every surface, (who knew it sounded like hitting a pipe on metal when you smack soft sand) 
There’s this strange inconsistent shiny texture i cant turn off, looking at freeman’s mind i dont see that, and i dont remember it, its annoying and only on specific parts of the gun, 
Ive made it as far as residue processing and ive just stoped. the strange shinny texture glitches here and splinter’s off, almost like how raggdols would noodle in fall out or world at war, they just shoot off and splinter across the map, and this covers the entire screen, 
The AI in areas is broken, head crabs wont lunge at you when you stand right in front of them, good thing for those who play on hard mode like me! 
Sounds all over break, sometimes they just dont play as if there’s not enough sound channels. 
Thats all i can name after spending a good portion of my day playing this game, 
There’s no reason to play this game, and almost no reason to buy it outside of garry’s mod assets, 
But hey, at least its on the source engine, and that makes it all better riiiiiiiiiight *just go buy black mesa already*",76561198057749968,Negative

149345250,240," A Heart-Wrenching Battle: Counter-Strike: Source on My Ancient, Despair-Inducing Laptop

My lamentable journey with Counter-Strike: Source on my utterly decrepit laptop is a heart-wrenching saga of unrelenting despair. This once-beloved classic has become a cruel reminder of my laptop's pitiable state, and it's a tale that ought to serve as a warning to all who dare tread this melancholic path.

As I booted up Counter-Strike: Source, the grim reality of my laptop's misery was undeniable. It demanded the most brutal sacrifice: the obliteration of every vestige of graphical fidelity. The outcome? A nightmarish, desolate wasteland that bore no relation to the game's past grandeur. Textures, like the fading memories of a lost love, were a fragmented and disfigured mess.

Frames per second? Anaemic and feeble, as if measured in geological eras. Aiming was a lesson in futility, a relentless exercise in despair. Smooth game-play was but a dream, forever out of reach.

In a universe where every split-second decision is crucial, I was condemned to a perpetual state of inferiority. Every engagement was a painful symphony of missed opportunities, every lost firefight a reminder of my utter powerlessness.

Loading screens? They were like a never-ending torment, each one a fresh wound to my wounded spirit. Each loading screen was a tombstone of hope, a reminder that I was tethered to a sinking ship.

In the end, Counter-Strike: Source on my beleaguered laptop was a descent into the abyss of desolation. It left me in the throes of heartache, my aspirations crushed beneath the weight of obsolescence. If you dare to follow in my footsteps, be prepared for a journey devoid of hope. Perhaps it's time to release the past, to let go of nostalgia, and to invest in a future free from the shackles of a laptop that's been forsaken by time and technology. though my craptop was unbelievably bad, it is a fun game. 10/10, maybe someday i can play cs2",76561199131787371,Positive

Many monotonous heroes. A game with 80% heroes is no different. The only difference is the skins and skill effect. There are some really unique and interesting characters. All other 115 heroes play the same way. There are only two mechanical differences: melee and ranged combat.
Poor camera control. This is complete ******. Camera control is very inconvenient. The camera is positioned very close to the hero, which means you won't be able to see what's going on around the hero in a game that's all about that.

Annoying monster finishing system. It was done so crookedly and through the ass. A very boring start to the game. Targeting and finishing off creeps makes this process extremely tedious.

162438987,220,"Half-Life 2: Two Decades of Disappointment

Ah, Half-Life 2, the perennial golden child of the gaming world, forever basking in the adulation of its devotees. But allow me, dear readers, to peel back the layers of nostalgia and expose this overhyped relic for what it truly is: a tepid, uninspired mess that has aged about as gracefully as a bottle of milk left out in the sun.

Let's start with the gameplay, shall we? Oh, what an absolute joy it is to slog through the same tired mechanics that were stale even back in 2004. The shooting? About as satisfying as throwing pebbles at a brick wall. The supposed innovation of physics-based puzzles? More like a sad attempt to distract you from the fact that you're essentially just pushing buttons and pulling levers in a glorified tech demo.

And let's not forget the joyless procession of uninspired enemies that populate this virtual wasteland. From the mindless Combine soldiers to the laughably predictable headcrabs, it's like Valve raided the bargain bin of generic sci-fi tropes and called it a day. Oh, and don't even get me started on the boss battles, or lack thereof. Nothing quite says ""anticlimactic"" like facing off against a forgettable monstrosity that wouldn't look out of place in a B-movie from the '50s.

But perhaps the most egregious offense of Half-Life 2 is its pretentious attempts at storytelling. Oh, how it fancies itself a profound exploration of the human condition, with its heavy-handed allegories and ham-fisted attempts at social commentary. Newsflash, Valve: subtlety is not your strong suit. And don't even get me started on the silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, who couldn't emote if his life depended on it. Talk about a charisma vacuum.

And yet, despite its myriad flaws, Half-Life 2 continues to be lauded as a masterpiece of the medium, revered by legions of fanboys who seem content to overlook its glaring shortcomings. It's as if the mere mention of Valve's magnum opus is enough to send them into paroxysms of ecstasy, blind to the reality that they're worshiping at the altar of mediocrity.

In conclusion, Half-Life 2 is nothing more than a relic of a bygone era, propped up by the rose-tinted glasses of its fanatical fanbase. So go ahead, continue to sing its praises and bask in its faded glory. But don't expect me to join you in your delusions.

You're now able to add motion blur and other new graphical stuff that makes the game look a lot better. They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better.

18662401,240,"I cannot recommend this game in comparison to the much cleaner CS:GO.

CSS is a classic Counter-Strike game that features a lively community that continues to survive and thrive. But boy is it flawed.

Two words: Lag. Compensation.

This is the biggest issue I have with this game. Its lag compensation system really drags the game into the dirt, making all those BS shots around a corner a common occurance. I cannot tell you how many times I died while behind a sturdy wall. It's happened almost every time I've peaked around a corner, making peaking something near impossible if there's a good player shooting at you.

""Get better internet!"" I hear as I type this paragraph. I have/had pretty good internet, with an average ping way below 60. It's the fault of the server and the other players, which is a nice segway into the next topic of this review.

The ratio of modded servers to vanilla servers is about 10:1, and I'm being nice. When I say ""vanilla"" I mean that the server retains the fundamentals of a CSmatch: pistol round, (so you don't start at $16000) not deathrun, jailbreak, no shop of any kind, or any other gamemodes that belong in GMOD, and 

When you find a vanilla (or close, because most servers have a stat tracking mod) server, good luck having fun. Between the aforementioned lag compensation, the CS elitists, the stacked teams, and huge player count, (ranging in the 30s-40s) you will be getting stomped if you are even remotely fresh.

The game is a testament to how long a game lasts, with its large predecessor, Counter-Strike, still racking in plenty of players with double the modded servers and $16000 to start. People (namely self-proclaimed pros)  prefer the classics because they have found all the exploits and have established themselves in the CS community some how: through maps, sound packs, textures, or server mods.

The game is old and dated when compared to CSGO. CSS and it's predcessors are full of people grasping tightly to a game on its last legs, and would rather call players of CSGO ""scrubs"" than move on.",76561198031976112,Negative

You run through a series of levels only bringing your hero with you. The hero gains levels and you choose between different options to improve and keeping most of the items you find during the game, letting you customize your hero. There is the risk in the game that if you lose most of your leveled units your new unleveled units won't be able to defeat anything.

- nice community
- no squeakers bragging about how they fucked your mom

Cons:
- small playerbase
- this community called AvaMods hosts 30 servers that all redirect to their server in order to get more players, and in 2007 they hacked a rival's website and forums and managed to make them shut down. if you actually want some good servers: 66.85.14.124:27015 66.85.14.133:27015 - those two are 24/7 same map, the last one is avalanche, first one i forgot, and you can type /gunmenu to choose the gun you want

8712726,1250,"Great IF you have a good group of friends to play with.

The game is kind of dull alone. And very hard on the higher levels of difficulty. And I just didn't see the point in participating in those silent, multiplayer battles. Everyone is trying to level up their characters and seems only marginally interested in supporting each other. 

I played with ZBane and his friends and that started out really, really good. But as we moved to harder levels of difficulty, even that group of good folks produced the occasional sour note as players sometimes grabbed kills for themselves that other players needed. (Most of us eventually moved back to favouring Left 4 Dead 2.)

Between rounds of killing monsters, you have to get to the randomly placed gunshop. THAT is the biggest part of the strategy in the game - figuring out how to get close to the gunshop before the round ends, so that you have time to go there, buy your guns and ammo, then race to the best close defensible spot before the next round starts. Again, that can lead to sour notes, as people get caught and killed going to and from the gun shop on unfamiliar maps.

I hoped that when I'd maxed out a few classes to level 6, everything would be fun and cooperative, like Left 4 Dead. It was still kind of snippy now and then. Games are rarely the right level of difficulty - they are either too easy (with people just hanging around, letting others do all the killing until the final rounds of the game) or too hard (with people getting miffed at one another when their character dies, and they have no time to rebuild dangerous weapons before the game ends).

The voice-acting is fine, but there are far too few lines. For example, every player sounds exactly the same as they frequently repeat: Reloading!

I think I would have loved this game, if I wasn't so familiar with Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. But I am, and they're simply better co-op games. Playing Killing Floor is like choosing Yahoo search when Google is available. What's the point?",76561197998653716,Negative

anyway about the game.
but it straight out toxic environment.
especially sea server and i don't think other regions are any better.
i mean if you want to be a toxic player that's fine but there is no line that differentiates that. its all mixed up.
for example the reporting system, the smurfs, these are common problems that have existed from day 1. 
alot can be done to improve these conditions but maybe its not profitable to dota 2.
i mean people openly boost accounts buy and sell them.

92581081,30,"We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush.

Johannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly. Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.

The others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.

It was quiet. Too quiet.

The bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.

The sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.

But nothing could prepare us for what happened next.

A giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.

We opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.

Stewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.

One of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.

By now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon. Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.

I was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere. From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.

Waking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room. The only thing visible was a glowing box directly in front of me with words written on it. Squinting my eyes, I barely made out the small, black letters.

The box read:

Kicked from server. Reason: lol dont use MG skrub",76561197985924393,Positive

I would also try and run from enemies but it would always be out because of how often I need to use the flashlight, it doesn't last that long either.

When you die, you don't get your health restored so you'll end up being in a death loop until you manage to somehow evade all of the enemies. That happened a lot to me and there are barely any medkits around to keep your health up.

The game spawning a group of enemies without warning and you end up dying because they can drain your health fast and there are barely any medkits like I said before.

Some chapters are very gimmicky and go on for too long. One has you in a boat, another in a car and one that doesn't let you touch the ground or giant bugs spawn. The vehicles control terribly, the boat is very slippery and the car is janky in the way it moves and steers.

Bugs. In one chapter, you need to remove an orb from a generator or some other kind of machine while holding off against the combine. I tried to remove it multiple times with the gravity gun and it wouldn't let me. There's another glitch that made headcrabs invisible.

Not knowing where to go. It happened on so many occasions because so many parts of the maps look the same and it doesn't give you any hints about where you need to go.



What makes it boring is the story and gameplay. The story is another citizens vs control freak government type story. Some parts were predictable such as Dr. Mossman betrayal, it was so obvious. The gameplay is just running around and shooting, there's not much to it.",76561199018619831,Negative

It's not to say that what is here isn't very good, but it's just that there's not a lot of it. When I was saying earlier that this felt like a community mod, it's because it does. Most Half Life mods usually have some very obtuse puzzling going on, and this game has quite a few ""big brain"" moments. Some of them seem to make logical real-life sense, but some of them are just so ""...okay...what's the big brain move here, Gearbox?""

99961116,130,"[h1]A short, but still fun romp through Half-Life's addictive gameplay[/h1]

Half-Life: Blue Shift is a short expansion for Half-Life that takes you into the perspective of Barney Calhoun, a security guard at Black Mesa, and later a main character of Half-Life 2. This expansion takes place during the same Black Mesa Incident that Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force, and Half-Life Decay all take place in.

Sadly, while gameplay is still a blast, the most notable thing about this expansion for Half-Life is its relatively short length. Someone who has played other games in the series should have no problem beating this expansion in around 3 Hours. Unlike Opposing Force, this expansion does not include any new enemies, weapons, or expansive set pieces making Blue Shift seem somewhat bland. 

The reasoning for Half-Life: Blue Shift's lack of content and length is due to it's reason for existing at all: It was meant as a short addon for the cancelled Sega Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Thankfully, after the Dreamcast version of Half-Life was scrapped, we received Blue Shift for PC, which also brought the new HD weapon and character models from the console versions of Half-Life.

Despite its lack of content, short length, and rough upbringing; Half-Life Blue Shift is still definitely worth picking up on sale or as part of a bundle. Fans who enjoyed the main campaign of Half-Life or its expansion Opposing Force, will enjoy Half-Life Blue Shift for sharing the same addictive combat loop as its predecessors.",76561198170899013,Positive

170583119,620,"The best video game in the world. It is perfect and has no cons! The main mechanic is very unique and interesting (I guess everyone dreamed about portal gun in real life). It is a puzzle game so the main part of it - solving puzzles by using portals and other stuff. The graphics are very beautifull and the sound design is great. I am not a fan of looting and this game has ZERO looting and crafting, you just go forward and play! Game location is very unique. No open-world, you are a prisoner in the laboratory, not truly a prisoner...subject :)  So the game is pretty straightforward - you solve a puzzle in one room and then move to the next one. Levels are various and different from each other. But what makes the game so legendary? First of all - narrative. The plot is not a masterpiece but it's cool, it's really interesting, and the narrative makes it ten times better (there are so many theories and iceberg-videos on youtube about the game's story). But the most standout feature of the game, without a doubt is the main villain. The greates villain in the whole game industry. GLaDOS is amaizing, by using only her voice (which is exquisitely pleasant!) she manages to be incredibly charismatic. Her creative jokes, storytelling and trolling are magnificence! Throughout the game she talkes to you, making you smile even as she humiliates you! Also the game has a very cool ending scene with two unbelieveble songs and that make the end of the game more memorable and give even more emotions. I like watching people play this game to laugh from their ways of thinking. Some of them even cried at the end of the game. Besides all this, there is a co-op mode where you can solve hard puzzles with your friend using additional portals. Everyone knows that co-op makes the game much more fun and this case is no exception. But what to do if u liked the game but its finished and coop is finished too? You can play custom puzzles which are made by other people or create your own! Some of them are pretty simple and some are very interesting and creative! But even that is not all! There are a lot of different unofficial DLCs. Most of them aren't worth your time (like Portal: Revolution, its incedibly bad and boring). But a few are very hard and cool (Portal Stories: Mel is very difficult, Portal Reloaded has three portals, its a bit illogical but still good). All in all the game is perfect, just download and play it already!
P.S. Why the main poster of the game is so stupid? The robot is jumping from the portal to the same location where it stands...what?XD

There are ways to host buts by simply searching for it on Google, and Valve has allowed to happen. The multi billion company that has quite literally almost a complete monopoly on PC gaming are loosing to a bunch of basement dwellers. The game is 17 years old, yet extremely popular and has become Iconic with it's funny characters and memes.

Through extensive personal effort, I've stabilized this enough to play for up to an hour at a time, but the game will eventually CTD. It's my recommendation to either emulate, or if you have a 360, just buy an old copy at a secondhand store. Worth mentioning is that I also get full music, BUT ZERO DIALOGUE. The audio for these fully voiced conversations with the player character are all nonfunctional, or possibly just absent. Seriously, I took too long to give up, and can no longer get a refund. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE, DO NOT BUY THIS. If you're feeling cheeky, I'd also like to let you know that when I tried a GOG copy, I got the same results. One of the missing files is a regedit entry, if that helps to clarify the severity of the poor state of this game.",76561198055676118,Negative

Welp. Time to take a crack at this. 

I would love to write a positive review. This is a SUPER fun game. It's easy to pick up, lots of diverse playstyles with each merc, and charming, nonsensical characters. I would reccommend this to anyone, most things considered. keyword: most.

And then, of course, the bots. Valve has obviously been wearing a blindfold for however long this has been going on. they have obviously plugged their ears and sing ""LALALA IM NOT LISTENING"". In fact, they have ignored this issue for so long, that CHARLIE MOISTCRITIKAL PENGUINZ0 has made a video addressing it. 

these bots are a virus, my latest game being an example. There was something around 6-8 snipers on every team and they all had their rifles pointed to the sky as though straight out of Hamilton. i would play demoman, walk within ~5 meters, and BOOM. sniped. every time. Oh, and by the by, not all that later in the game, one of the bots called a vote for cheating against me, and had me kicked out.

Valve. if you see this, I hope you see reason, because what you are doing makes no sense. when you said you would save TF2, guess what happened. it popped up again. i see no evidence against the claim that if you do not fix this issue, it will pop up again. 

And again.

and AGAIN.

and to the player base, I sincerely hope we pull through out of this dark time for one of the internet's favorite games. Pardon my rant. may we win this war of mann vs machine.

171983844,570,"Highly addictive. Tons of anti-patterns. You just waste your life farming 30 minutes All the time, Forever.

Actually, I think I played this game for almost 18 years. It used to be played faster(remember when you could buy boots on the lane and even Orchid ?) 

+ the mother of all greeds : 0.003$ for another sound after 11 years ? But guess what ? On your bucks you have to do some astonishing crap (log-out twice, etc .etc. etc. | simply insane) but they don't ask for the same crap when they drag you your money ! (paying 'Plus') 

VALVE are highly suable for all these anti-patterns, in game, gameplay. Downloading inaccesibble TB for decades just to see a 'big' game ? 

This game is still installed in a folder called 'beta' + their DLC is still 'beta' ancient. And it's VALVE second revenue ! 

Nevermind the ancient engine(it's a FPS engine, as I remember).

Everything is mindblowing.

But I can't play anything else 'fast-paced' 'freely'( I really wasted my life just with this game), natively @GNU/Linux, so ... 

Maybe I love it and I hate it same time but I will still sue VALVE someday for everything I already said + everything i didn't. ( Refactored) 

After all, I think it's the most complex game available. 

P.S.: 'Dota Plus' isn't smart enough(as in 'ELO') to actually suggest you really genuine specific-game based builds. (it simply done to steal you 4$ and waste another one, making everything useless.) 

Actually, VALVE is suable just for those 0.003$ * all the 'good stuff'. 

If you don't allow as, the peons, to access those 40 wasted GB, just don't force us to kill the Global Bandwidth. (another lawsuit) (nevermind downloading just 'CDQuality' 1080p..)

To Be Continued ...(I waited a decade to be able to write this comm.) 

P.P.S. : Sorry for typos and another related grammar crap. I'm tired and I invite you to simply see why.

P.P.P.S. : Maybe the worst thing of all, ignoring VALVE's tremendous greed(after all, they sell a 3 minute developed awful 'skin' for hundreds of dollars, perfectly suable(Everything implying money should deserve it properly --I have in mind that 400$ Riki red dagger, blue or something is 3$ :| --they can't compete Blizzard anytime but they started to construct something nice, but you can't build something beautiful on a foundation of crap) & also, ignoring all those HUDs, sounds, and everything mentioned that you can't access but you always download(why we should pay for something we can't use?) is , actually the MMR system :

Now, read carefully: I find it pretty simply and perfect to just consider K/D*A ratio, as it was the case, maybe for HoN?(a better game but now abandoned for unknown reasons; at least for Linux and they never check the code for all the hell of security bugs)(you can still play it somehow but on Windows), because I don't find it fair to punish all the good players(after all, you do kills, assists and don't feed, the core of the game), throwing them(us) to the 'Heralnd's Hell' : Feeders, Psychos, Crazy people or just pure-noobs.

Give the MMR algo back the astonishing simple K/D*A or at least a geomean, and let us play with the 'Divines'. (in HoTS I used to win with lvl. 1000 players, things as that) because we play better when we have better team, sorry for the tautology. 

It's simply impossible to make way through otherwise without playing strictly in team, which is expensive for a causal veteran. (after all, we have to do some real stuff with our lives but here VALVE could help us make a living..).

Well, again, sorry for this mess in all of its forms and consider it carefully. 
(Dota 1 used to have 4GB and that's because it had everything Wacraft 3 ment already)
* After all I saw @HackerNews(ycombinator) all these years, I think it's perfectly possible for the 'Core' game(the game 99% of all of us play anyway) to have uncompressed just 10GB, you just have to refactor the hell out of it. 

Don't force us to pay for want we don't get ! It's the mother of fascism ! (Again, TBC) 

P^n+1 S : I forgot to mention an ancient annoying bug : Why you keep asking for compiling shaders(nevermind you can't do it in GPU, where the shaders live!), when I disabled that thing in-game a thousand times ?! 

It's perfectly clear that STEAM software isn't 'aware' of the in-game setting and respect that ! 

(BTW: when AMD Anti-Lag2, all those new 'techs' ? When, after all I wrote, 'Dota 3' ?) Just spend some money, in comes recession anyway ! People got tired of Mcdonalds and malls but games are just some autistic C/P of all the good ideas in a shitty way. GL !  (1)

(1) Actually, I get astoned to see 'new' games released that look as it was 2000 or even 1999 but they dare to ask some good bucks for them ! I use to buy all the PCGames&Co. Magazines 24 years ago !  I saw the evolution of hardware and the gaming industry. Now you're all Suable ! (maybe for billions) Good luck #European Commission. --maybe they will have the time for that. (nevermind that you should also be considered a 'gate-keeper' --but this limit has to go down)

EDIT(about MMR's 'Philosophy'):  

After all, you insist that 'is just a game', so, if that's so, why you put all the bucks on winning ? Considering the plain stupid calculation of the MMR I presented, it would make it far playable, giving all the players to prove themselves beyond depending to win. Just think about it, @VALVE. 

It's the Herald's Hell otherwise. 

We're simply punished for people that can't fetch the full picture. If I have a >1 K/D*A, just strictly consider this time of 'MMR'. After-all, you're playing raw capitalism. Respect that completely. Thanks !",76561199529880205,Negative

I have always struggled to connect with my son as he spends most of his free time playing games online or watching others play on YouTube. As a busy single father, I found it difficult to spend quality time with him.

But recently, my son introduced me to a game called Counter-Strike: Source, and I decided to create a Steam account so we could play together. It had been decades since I last played a video game, so I was quite rusty. But my son patiently taught me how to play and we started bonding over this game.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun we had playing together. It was like we were solving a mystery together, laughing and having a great time. Playing video games with my son reminded me of the joy of being a kid and it helped me to connect with my son on a whole new level. We even started spending more time together outside of the game, going on walks and enjoying other activities.

As a single father, it can be difficult to find common ground with my son, but video games have given us a new way to bond and spend quality time together. I am grateful for this opportunity to connect with my son and make lasting memories together.",76561198040016889,Positive

And here we are. I spoke of my return to this shore. It has been a circuitous path to lands I once knew, and surprising to see how much the terrain has changed. Enough time has passed that few remember me, or what I was saying when last I spoke, or what precisely we hoped to accomplish. At this point, the resistance will have failed or succeeded, no thanks to me. Old friends have been silenced, or fallen by the wayside. I no longer know or recognize most members of the research team, though I believe the spirit of rebellion still persists. I expect you know better than I the appropriate course of action, and I leave you to it.

169645551,730,"I wont say its not worth trying it but i just dont recommend it as an investment.

1. This game is full of cheaters and im not exaggerating. VAC is not working and no one from the development team really seems to care. 

2. So much content is missing from the older version (CS:GO) that you can hardly call this a new version of the game. I Get that they are constantly adding new setting and such but key commands are missing that the majority of the playerbase used.

3. In the ""short"" period that CS2 has been released, at least 180.000 active players have quit the game for the only reason of not being able to run the game properly. The new lighting system and new graphics have caused many people to leave the game due to not being able to run the game to at least 60 FPS without lag spikes. LAG SPIKES, even people that have decent pc's and run the game with good FPS have problems with lag spikes, and people who do know how terrible it is for your game to freeze mid fight and lose you the round.

4. No new content has been added. Since the release of the whole CS2 thing no actual new content has been added. Yes you can call the kilowatt case with the zeus skins and a new knife content but its not something very major. Well what ill say is very expected and its gotten boring hearing it from other people too but WE NEED A NEW OPERATION. Im not 100% sure that this will save the game but it surely will help it.

5. Tick rate. i wont yap too much about this one cuz people already know what ill say but ill hop in to replay's and see that shots that were clearly hitting the enemy are going through him or just not hitting him, i dont know very much about stuff like this but ive done my research and i can safely say that what i see is not what i get.

What it gives you is a ton of great missions, a bunch of interesting characters with great VO, and constant, genuine challenge throughout.
